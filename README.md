# Assessment Two: Pokedex with React

In this assessment you will work ***individually*** in order to finish a partially implemented website. The **only** files you will need to work with are:

- [`src/App.js`](https://gitlab.com/york-u-fs1010/assessment-two/blob/master/src/App.js)
- [`src/components/Pokemon.js`](https://gitlab.com/york-u-fs1010/assessment-two/blob/master/src/components/Pokemon.js)
- [`src/components/MainHeader.js`](https://gitlab.com/york-u-fs1010/assessment-two/blob/setup/src/components/MainHeader.js)

In this repository you are provided with a partially complete implementation of teh Pok√©dex homework assignment that uses React. The goal of this assessment is to complete the items listed in the rubric. A grade of 100% should result in a webpage identical to the one we've seen through the homework assignment.




## In the project directory, you can run:

**`npm start`:** Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

**`npm test`:** Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information. Just like the last assessment, we can check our work using this command instead. Results will be shown in the command line.

***If a test is passing double check that your page is working in the web browser. The tests are meant as an aide, not as a method of marking.***
